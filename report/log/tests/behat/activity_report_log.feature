  Scenario: Report selectors should be targeted toward course module
    Given I am on the "Test page 1" Activity page logged in as "admin"
    When I navigate to "Logs" in current page administration
    Then "menuid" "select" should not exist
    And "modid" "select" should not exist
    And I should see "All participants" in the "user" "select"
    And I should see "All days" in the "date" "select"
    And I should see "All sources" in the "origin" "select"
    And I should see "All events" in the "edulevel" "select"
    And "Page" "link" should exist in current page administration

  Scenario: Report submission stays in the same course module page
    Given I am on the "Test page 1" Activity page logged in as "admin"
    When I navigate to "Logs" in current page administration
    And I click on "Get these logs" "button"
    Then "Page" "link" should exist in current page administration
